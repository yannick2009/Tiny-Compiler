# TINY-COMPILER (Still in development)

## Description

This project is a lightweight compiler built using the **Go programming language**. It is designed to compile a Lisp-like language into C code.  

The primary objective of this project is educational, aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of how compilers work by implementing one from scratch. Through this project, you'll explore the fundamental concepts of parsing, syntax tree generation, code analysis, and the transformation of high-level constructs into low-level C code.

Whether you're passionate about language design or just curious about the inner workings of compilers, this project serves as a practical and engaging way to delve into the world of programming language theory and systems programming.

## Features

- **Lisp-like syntax**: The language is inspired by Lisp, with a simple syntax that makes it easy to parse and compile.
- **C code generation**: The compiler generates C code that can be compiled and executed on any platform with a C compiler.
- **Basic arithmetic operations**: The language supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
